## Febuary 2025 - Sortable and Control Group

We've added a new Sortable component and a new Control Group component.

### Sortable

A drag and drop component for reordering items in a list or grid. Sortable is built on top of [@dnd-kit](https://dndkit.com)'s [sortable](https://docs.dndkit.com/presets/sortable) preset.

<ComponentPreview name="sortable-demo" />

[See more examples](/docs/components/sortable)

### Control Group

A component for grouping form controls like text inputs, buttons, selects and other elements into a single cohesive unit. When used together with Input Base, you can create highly customizable and flexible input layouts for a variety of use cases.
