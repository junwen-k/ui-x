## Introduction

Efficiently rendering large lists and tabular data is a common challenge in UI development. By leveraging [virtualization](https://www.patterns.dev/vanilla/virtual-lists/), we can significantly enhance performance.

    height="1135"

    className="border dark:hidden shadow-sm rounded-lg overflow-hidden mt-6 w-full"
  />

After exploring various libraries, I found [virtua](https://github.com/inokawa/virtua) to be one of the most intuitive and effective choices. Its straightforward API eliminates the need for additional wrapping, allowing you to integrate it seamlessly with other tools like [@dnd-kit](https://dndkit.com) and [Radix UI](https://www.radix-ui.com/primitives).

Instead of creating a custom `<Virtualizer>` component, this guide provides practical examples to help you virtualize different components effectively.

**Important**: Use virtualization judiciously. It's best suited for scenarios involving large lists or tables, rather than squeezing out every bit of "performance optimizations".

## Installation

1. Add `virtua` dependency:

```bash
npm install virtua
```

## Examples

### Default

<ComponentPreview name="virtualizer-demo" />

### Horizontal

<ComponentPreview name="virtualizer-horizontal" />

### Grid

<ComponentPreview name="virtualizer-grid" />

### Table

<ComponentPreview name="virtualizer-table" />

<Callout className="mt-6">
**Note:** Until virtua improves its support for [table virtualization](https://github.com/inokawa/virtua/issues/312), you will need to manually set the cell width because of the current use of absolute positioning.

</Callout>

### Combobox

To virtualize a `<Combobox>`, you'll need to attach the `scrollRef` to the `<ComboboxContent>`, as it serves as the scrollable container.

Additionally, you'll need to manage the `inputValue` and perform filtering externally, as the default filtering does not support virtualization.

<Callout className="mt-4">

**Tip**: If you use `<ComboboxGroup>` with `heading`, you'll need to set the `startMargin` to match the heading's height. This ensures that the virtualized items are positioned correctly within the dropdown.
