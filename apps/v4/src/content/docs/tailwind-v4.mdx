description: How to use junwen-k/ui-x with Tailwind v4 and React 19.
---

We're excited to announce that all components in junwen-k/ui-x have been updated to support Tailwind v4 and React 19!

If you encounter any issues while using or installing v4 components, please don't hesitate to [open an issue](https://github.com/junwen-k/ui-x/issues/new) on GitHub. Your feedback helps us improve the library and provide better support for the community.

## What's New

Building on shadcn/ui's [latest changes](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/tailwind-v4#whats-new), this update also includes:

- Integrated shadcn/ui's [component registry](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/registry) system for better compatibility with shadcn/ui's ecosystem.
- Revamped and updated documentation site with latest v4 components, improving overall user experience.
- Integrated [v0](https://v0.dev/) support, enhancing AI-powered workflows.

## Upgrade Your Project

Since our components are built on top of shadcn/ui, we recommend following their comprehensive [Tailwind v4 migration guide](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/tailwind-v4#upgrade-your-project).

All components in junwen-k/ui-x have already been migrated following these guidelines, so you can be confident they'll work seamlessly with Tailwind v4 in your project.

## Looking for v3?

If you're not ready to migrate yet, you can still access the v3 documentation at [v3-ui-x.junwen-k.dev](https://v3-ui-x.junwen-k.dev). However, we recommend starting new projects with v4 to take advantage of the latest improvements.
