---

**Similar to shadcn/ui, this is not a component library, It is how you build your component library.**

junwen-k/ui-x is a thoughtfully crafted extension that provides additional components while maintaining the same principles of being open, composable and customizable.

As junwen-k/ui-x is built as an extension of shadcn/ui, it inherits the core philosophies and approaches. For the foundational concepts, please refer to shadcn/ui's [documentation](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs).

## Philosophy

The components in this extension are built around three key principles:

- **Intuitive Developer Experience:** Each component's API mirrors Radix UI conventions and shadcn/ui patterns, creating an intuitive and familiar experience.
- **Natural Extension:** Components are thoughtfully designed to feel like natural additions to the shadcn/ui ecosystem, maintaining the same level of quality and coherence.
- **Open and Customizable:** Like shadcn/ui, you have full access to the component code, allowing complete customization to fit your needs.
- **AI-Ready:** Components are designed to be compatible with AI tools like [v0](https://v0.dev), enabling seamless integration with AI-powered development workflows.

    <AccordionContent>
      The components are designed to work seamlessly with shadcn's design system
      and distribution approach. They integrate naturally with your existing
      shadcn/ui components while maintaining consistent styling, behavior, and
      developer experience.

  <AccordionItem value="faq-2">
    <AccordionTrigger>Why are there additional primitives?</AccordionTrigger>
    <AccordionContent>
      This extension includes additional primitive components for features not
      covered by Radix UI. By maintaining the separation between primitive logic
      and styled components, we ensure cleaner code and better maintainability
      while expanding the available functionality.
